# iris-flower-classification
The Iris Flower Classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. This classification is based on four key features of the flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By analyzing these features, we use machine learning models like logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines to build a predictive model.

The dataset, first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, contains 150 samples (50 samples per species). The goal is to train a model to accurately predict the species of a flower based on its measured features. The data exhibits a clear separation for Iris-setosa but some overlap between Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica, making it a great example for understanding classification problems and decision boundaries.
